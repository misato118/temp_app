## Overview 📝

This is a full-stack item rental platform designed to demonstrate scalable full-stack architecture with multiple user roles: Renters, Companies (item owners), and Admins.

The motivation behind building this item rental application came up by observing the Canadian market.

I noticed that while there are some rental services available, they are often limited in scope—focused on specific categories like clothing or equipment—and typically offer fixed pricing, which can be prohibitively expensive.

Given the high cost of living in Canada, I wanted to create a more flexible and inclusive platform where individuals can rent a wide range of items, from clothes and tools to furniture, based on the renter’s asking price.

This model not only promotes affordability but also encourages resource sharing, helping people save money and reduce unnecessary purchases.

Through this project, I aimed to provide a practical solution that makes everyday items more accessible to everyone.

## Usage 💡

This project simulates real-world workflows for three user types:

- **🧑 Renters**
  - Browse and filter available items
  - Submit rental applications with custom price and duration
  - Estimate delivery fees based on address
  - Leave item reviews after use

- **💼 Companies**
  - Submit item listings (subject to admin approval)
  - Manage item availability and inventory
  - Review and respond to rental applications

- **🖥️ Admins** (in progress)
  - Review and approve submitted item listings
  - Oversee and manage renter/company accounts
